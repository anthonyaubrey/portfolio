    <p class="open-sans">This campaign was for a friend and talented musician, Matt Clarke Jenkins. The campaign aimed to raise awareness for mental health. At the event we sold prints and shirts in order to raise money for the Queensway Carleton Hospital. Their Hopes Rising campaign focuses on mental health stigmas and aims to revive the facilities at the hospital.</p>
